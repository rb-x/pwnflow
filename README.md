## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
  - TailwindCSS for styling
  - XYFlow for mind map visualization
  - Zustand for state management

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.12)
  - Neo4j graph database for storing relationships
  - Redis

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ and pnpm (for development)
- Python 3.12+ (for backend development)

### Quick Start with Docker

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rb-x/pwnflow.git
cd pwnflow
```

2. Make the run script executable:
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
```

3. Start the development environment:
```bash
./run.sh dev
```

This will automatically:
- Check for Docker and Docker Compose
- Create `.env.development` with secure defaults (Neo4j password: `password`)
- To enable the AI feature, press CTRL+C. Then, add your [Gemini API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) in your .env file & restart the application by running `./run.sh dev`
- Start all services (Frontend, Backend, Neo4j, Redis)
- Display service URLs

4. Access the application:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Neo4j Browser: http://localhost:7474
- Redis Commander: http://localhost:8081



### Other Commands

```bash
./run.sh prod   # Start production environment (with nginx)
./run.sh stop   # Stop all containers
./run.sh clean  # Stop and remove all containers and volumes
```

### Development Setup

#### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)
```bash
./run.sh dev
```
This starts all services with hot-reload enabled. Perfect for full-stack development.

#### Option 2: Manual Development Setup

If you prefer running services individually without Docker:

**Frontend Development**
```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # Runs on http://localhost:5173
```

**Backend Development**
```bash
cd backend
pipenv install --dev
pipenv shell
python main.py    # Runs on http://localhost:8000
```

**Note**: For manual setup, you'll need Neo4j and Redis running locally:
- Neo4j: Download from [neo4j.com](https://neo4j.com/download/)
- Redis: `brew install redis` (macOS) or `apt install redis` (Linux)

```

## 🔧 Configuration

The `run.sh` script handles all environment configuration automatically:

- **Development** (`./run.sh dev`): Creates `.env.development` with secure defaults
- **Production** (`./run.sh prod`): Creates `.env.production` with strong passwords

To add AI features, simply edit the generated `.env.development` or `.env.production` file and add your `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

### Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Run the production setup:
```bash
./run.sh prod
```

This will:
- Check for existing `.env.production` file
- Generate secure passwords and secrets if needed
- Prompt you to update CORS origins for your domain
- Run security checklist before starting
- Start all services behind nginx proxy

2. On first run, update `.env.production`:
- Set your domain in `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS`
- Add your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` for AI features (optional)
- Review all generated passwords

3. Create your first user (registration is disabled by default for security):

```bash
# Create admin user via CLI (inside backend container)
docker exec -it pwnflow-backend-prod python create_user.py create admin admin@yourcompany.com

# Or using docker-compose:
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec backend python create_user.py create admin admin@yourcompany.com

# The script will output:
# User created successfully:
# Username: admin
# Password: <secure-random-password>
# Email: admin@yourcompany.com
```

4. Additional production steps:

 ⚠️ Security Notice: We absolutely don't recommend exposing Pwnflow to the internet. If you must:
  1. Whitelist trusted IP addresses through your WAF or firewall
  2. Registration is disabled by default - only manual user creation via SSH

- Set up SSL/TLS certificates (Let's Encrypt recommended)
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Implement regular security updates

## 📚 Documentation

🚧 Documentation is currently being updated for the new full-stack architecture

## 🎯 Use Cases

Pwnflow is perfect for:
- **Penetration Testers**: Track methodology and findings
- **Security Analysts**: Document investigation workflows
- **Incident Responders**: Map out response procedures
- **Security Teams**: Share knowledge and methodologies
- **Researchers**: Organize and visualize attack paths

## 🛡️ Security

Pwnflow is designed with security in mind:
- **Privacy-First AI**: AI features only access node titles and descriptions - never sensitive data like findings or variables
- **Encrypted Exports**: Secure sharing with AES-256-GCM encryption
- **Zero Telemetry**: No tracking or data collection
- **Open Source**: Full transparency and community-driven security
